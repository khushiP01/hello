IvyProfile Landing Page (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Run locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build static files:

```
npm run build
```

The production build will be generated in `dist/` and can be deployed on any static host.

Notes:
- Alias `@` points to `src` (configured in `vite.config.js`).
- Tailwind theme colors are driven by CSS variables defined in `src/index.css`.
